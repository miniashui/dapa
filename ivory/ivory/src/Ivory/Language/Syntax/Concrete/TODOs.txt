TODOs:

- Integrate the bitdata quasiquoter.

- Include break statements?  This isn't trivial, as we need to add the correct
  effects.

- Add a parser for abstract structs and string defs (structs).

- Right now, there is just expression anti-quotation.  Other anti-quotation?

- Add externs (procs, areas, etc.).

- C arrays.

- Add public/private syntax?

- Add other loop statements?
