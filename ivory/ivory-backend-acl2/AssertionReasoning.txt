Interprocedural Assertion Verification for Ivory Compiler

Goals

Build an analyzer that can verify most assertions in a reasonable amount of time
for the compiler to remove as many runtime checks as possible.

Provide a hook for Ivory compiler that verifies and removes assertions and
reports assertions that failed to verify:

  assertsFold :: [Module] -> IO [Module]




Prior Assertions as Lemmas

An assertion will use all prior assertions as lemmas, regardless if they
have been proven or not.  But an assertion will not use any post assertions
as lemmas as this could establish a cycle that could allow false assertions
to be incorrectly verified.  For example assume we had:

  assert false  -- Assertion 1.
  assert false  -- Assertion 2.

If we use all assertions as lemmas, this leads to the following
proposition for verification:

  Assertion 1: assert2 -> assert1
  Assertion 2: assert1 -> assert2

Since both assertions are false, both are incorrectly verified
and removed from the runtime.  Using only prior assertions breaks
this loop.  Now the propositions look this this:

  Assertion 1: assert1
  Assertion 2: assert1 -> assert2

In this case, assertion 1 fails to prove and remains a runtime check.
(More importantly, the verifier reports a proof failure and the user fixes the bug.)
Assertion 2 passes, but only because assertion 1 is false.  Assertion 2
is removed from the runtime, but this tolerable since the assertion 1 check remains.

It may be possible to use a different ordering scheme other than declaration order
for lemma assisted proofs, but this will not be explored.




Procedural Abstraction

When a function is called, the analyzer must handle the cases when:
  - the function does or does not have interface contracts, i.e. requires and ensures
  - the function is either recursive or mutually recursive with other functions
  - the function is mutually recursive with the caller

If a function being called is not recursive nor has
any recursive sub-calls, the function's body can be inlined
by the analyzer.  This would be especially helpful
for the cases of analyzer generated functions, such as for loops
where Ivory does not have the ability to specify contracts
(maybe Ivory should have means to specify entry and exit conditions for loops).
For simplicity of implementation, the analyzer will not
do any inlining and will not look inside any functions called
beyond the interface contracts.

If a callee has an input contract, the contract
will be applied to the arguments and checked like an assertion.
If the input contract can be verified at every call site, the input
contract can be removed from the callee.  (Care must be taken for recursion.)

If a callee has an output contract, this will be
treated as a lemma for following assertions in the callers body.
During verification of the callee, the output contract will be 
treated like an assertion.  If it is verified the output contract
can be removed.

If a callee does not have an output contract, the analyzer
will treat the return value and the global program state as
free variables, i.e. universally quantified.




Example

function f1 (a, b, c) {
  requires f1_requires
  ensures  f1_ensures
  ...
}

function f2 (a, b) {     -- Arguments translated to an environment record: let Env = [(a, value), (b, value)] :: [(Name, Value)]
  requires f2_requires   -- Requires translated to a predicate on the state and environment: (State, Env) -> Bool
  ensures  f2_ensures    -- Ensures translated to a predicate on the state, environment, and return value: (State, Env, Value) -> Bool
  stmts1                 -- Statements transform state and environment: (State, Env) -> (State, Env)
  assert assert1         -- Assert expressions translated to predicate on state and environment: (State, Env) -> Bool
  stmts2
  assert assert2
  stmts3
  let tmp = f1 (arg1, arg2, arg3)
  stmts4
  assert assert3
  stmts5
  return ret

      vc4

VC for f2_ensures:

  forall state0 a b .
    let env0 = [("a", a), ("b", b)]
    let (state1, env1) = stmts1 (state0, env0)
    let (state2, env2) = stmts2 (state1, env1)
    let (state3, env3) = stmts3 (state2, env2)
    let vc1 = f2_requires (state0, env0) -> assert1 (state1, env1)
    let vc2 = vc1 -> assert2 (state2, env2)
    let envCall = [("a", env3["arg1"]) , ("b", env3["arg2"]) , ("c", env3["arg3"])]
    let vc3 = vc2 -> f1_requires (state3, envCall)
    forall stateCall tmp .
      let (state4, env4) = stmts4 (stateCall, env3)
      let vc4 = vc3 -> f1_ensures (stateCall, envCall, tmp) -> assert (state4, env4)
      let (state5, env5) = stmts5 (state4, env4)
      let vc5 = vc4 -> f2_ensures (state5, env5, env5["ret"])




Recursion and Removing Input Contracts

As long as all input contracts are verified at all call sites,
the input contracts can be safely removed.
Care must be taken for functions that can be called from the outside,
i.e. non Ivory functions, as these are instances of non-verifiable
call sites.




If Statement Encoding

function f (a, b) {

  forall state0 a b .
    let env0 = [("a", a), ("b", b)]
    let vc1 = require1 (state0, env0) 
    let (state1, env1) = stmts1 (state0, env0)
    let (state2, env2) = stmts2 (state1, env1)
    let vc2 = vc1 -> cond1 (state1, env1) -> assert2 (state2, env2)
    let (state3, env3) = stmts3 (state1, env1)
    let vc3 = vc1 -> ! cond1 (state1, env1) -> assert3 (state3, env3)
    let (state4, env4) = stmts4 (if cond1 (state1, env1) then state2 else state3, env1)
    let vc4 = vc1 -> vc2 -> vc3 -> assert4 (state4, env4)

Misc Items

Providing the compiler with 'verifyAndRemoveAssertions' assumes
the analyzer can handle, not necessary analyze, all possible Ivory code.
In its current from, the Ivory-to-ACL2 compiler errors out
whenever it comes across an program construct that is not
supported.  With verification at compile time, these errors
will have to be handled without throwing an exception.
It will take some effort to make the code base robust to all inputs.
