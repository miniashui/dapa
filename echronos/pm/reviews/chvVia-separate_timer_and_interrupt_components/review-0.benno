RTOS Task Review
=======================

Task name: chvVia-separate_timer_and_interrupt_components

Conclusion: Rework

Overall comments:

I think it is not necessary to have both a timer_tick_pending and a timer_interrupt_flag maintained.
It should be sufficient to treat the interrupt_flag as equivalent to pending.
The current approach appears to add additional state that is unnecessary.
