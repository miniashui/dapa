Conclusion: Rework

Overall comments: Currenly ./x.py x-test fails.

[[(stg): this is caused by the function 'test_release()' which is not a unit-test function but which is picked up as such by the unit-test framework.
Renamed the function to release_test() to avoid it being detected as a unit-test function.]]
