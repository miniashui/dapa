Conclusion: Rework

Overall comments:

Suggest reworking the python path context manager as:

@contextmanager
def python_path(*paths):
    import sys
    paths = [os.path.abspath(path) for path in paths]
    # I think this ensure the paths aren't inserted in reverse order
    # if that is intended put reversed(..) around paths.
    sys.path = paths + sys.path
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        # Remove the added paths directly from the front.
        sys.path = sys.path[len(paths):]
