+    The directories can be specified
+    - as individual arguments of the constructor, e.g., "with PythonPath('foo', 'bar'):"
+    - as list argument(s) of the constructor, e.g., "with PythonPath(['foo', 'bar']):"

I would support only one way, not both.
I'd probably use the first to be consistent with `os.path.join()`.

I would consider writing it as a simple function using the @contextlib.contextmanager
