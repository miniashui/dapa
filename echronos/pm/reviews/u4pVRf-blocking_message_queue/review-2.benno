RTOS Task Review
=======================

Task name: u4pVRf-blocking_message_queue
Version reviewed: 9b53e041265af819a0969e95fb32486541cc824e

Conclusion: Rework

Overall comments:

I think this is getting pretty close.
My main comment at this point is that the 3 lines in the new message-queue-core component could/should go directly in e.g. rigel.c.
This approach would directly match the way in which the mutex code works.
