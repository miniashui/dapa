Overall comments:
Thanks for those fixes.
Regarding the 'intentionally left blank' comments, I'm okay with removing them if we're of the consensus that there is no problem having license headers on a blank file (i.e. nobody else flags it for reversion).
I see your point that readers who don't understand the purpose of __init__.py files will be confused regardless of whether such a comment is present.
