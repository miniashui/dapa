Specific comments
=================

Location: packages/machine-qemu-ppce500/example/testcase.py:33
Comment 1: Rework
Windows-style line ending.

[stg: converted to unix style]

Location: pylib/tests.py:37
Comment 2: Rework
The 'top_path' function imported here from .utils does not appear to be used.

[stg: removed unused import]

Location: pylib/tests.py:351-356
Comment 3: Rework
The variables and fields initialized here do not appear to be used.

[stg: removed unused code, but extended command line argument handling such that all options are passed on to the nose test framework]

Location: packages/machine-qemu-ppce500/example/__init__.py:20
Comment 4: Rework
Now that we have license headers, I think we need a "intentionally left blank" notice here, as we've done elsewhere (e.g. rtos/__init__.py, prj/app/lib/util/__init__.py).
Should this be added to our internal conventions?

[stg: I don't see the problem that the comment "intentionally left blank" solves, so I remove those comments where they were present]
