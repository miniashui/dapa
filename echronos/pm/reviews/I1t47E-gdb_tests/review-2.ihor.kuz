RTOS Task Review
=======================

Task name: I1t47E-gdb_tests
Version reviewed: 92ade92af1c3a33fd178cdbbfdf507dc645b7270

Conclusion: Rework

Overall comments:
The 'intentionally left blank' comments were added when we were automatically adding license tags.
It gave the script doing it an idea of what the header format should be.
Now that that's been done, it's fine to remove that comment.


Specific comments
=================

Location: *.txt
Comment:
I don't think that .txt is a good suffix for the test output files.
Normally it implies a readable document, this is not the case here.

[stg: changed the extensions of those file names to gdbout]
