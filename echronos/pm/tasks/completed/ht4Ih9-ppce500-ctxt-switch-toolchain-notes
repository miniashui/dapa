Task: ht4Ih9-ppce500-ctxt-switch-toolchain-notes
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The PowerPC context switch implementations (both preemptive and non-preemptive) make some assumptions about the calling convention (e.g. use of EABI) that are only documented in-line in the source code.

We should at the very least add a note to the proper user documentation about the expectations placed on the user regarding their toolchain configuration.


Goals
--------

Document in the user manual assumptions made by the PowerPC context switch implementations re: toolchain config.


Test Plan
---------

Build the user manual.
Read and review the documentation additions.
