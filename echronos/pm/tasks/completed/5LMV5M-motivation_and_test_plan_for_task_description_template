Task: 5LMV5M-motivation_and_test_plan_for_task_description_template
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The template for task descriptions, such as this one, currently only contains the section 'Goals'.
However, it improves overall project traceability and quality to have each task accompanied by
* a reviewable justification why it is necessary
* a reviewable test plan outlining metrics for the success of the task implementation
These two aspects should be laid out at the outset of a task to provide context, focus, and guidance both to the implementation and the review process.


Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to add a 'Motivation' and a 'Test Plan' section to the task description template.


Test Plan
---------

Since this task has no impact on the release artifacts of the RTOS, code review is sufficient.
