Task: joti38-remove-cpp-module-support
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The CPP approach to module configuration was useful during initial bootstrap, however the templating approach is now stable, and the CPP approach adds little value.
The CPP configuration approach should be removed to simplify the prj tool and make configuration simpler.
