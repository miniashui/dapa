Task: 2fF4DZ-fix-asm-comment-syntax
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Previous task uEJdLU-legal-asm-comments incorrectly used ';' as a comment character for GNU assembler files.
Unfortunately GNU assembler files have different comment characters based on the underlying architecture.
Instead use /* */ comments for GNU assembler and ';' on other assemblers.
To distinguish between the two .s will be used exclusively for GNU assembler files, and .asm for other.
