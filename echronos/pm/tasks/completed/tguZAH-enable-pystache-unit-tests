Task: tguZAH-enable-pystache-unit-tests
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The pystache library we used has been modified from the upstream pystache library.
In particular it has been set up so it can be easily used in place, and also packaged in to a frozen binary.
Also, it has been converted to Python 3.
In this original conversion process care was not taken to ensure the unit tests still ran correctly.
Additionally, the port mostly relied on the automatic 2to3 tool, which is not always ideal.
This makes it difficult to add additional improvement to Pystache.
There is a desire to extend the existing pystache in a variety of ways, so having a clean base on which to do this is desired.

The goal of this branch is to make sure that the Pystache unit tests correctly execute.
Additionally, some aspects of the code based may be improved to work better with Python 3.
