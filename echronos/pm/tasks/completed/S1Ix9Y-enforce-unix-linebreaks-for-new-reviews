Enforce Unix line-breaks for new reviews
========================================

Goal
----
The x.py tool supports a new-review command which creates files containing review templates.
Depending on the platform and python installation, the created files may be based on Windows line-breaks.
This violates the project policy of consistently using Unix-style line-breaks.
The x.py tool shall be changed so that the created files are based on Unix-style line-breaks.
