Task: ogb1UE-kochab-documentation-base
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

No user manual is currently generated for Kochab because the base kochab/docs.md doesn't exist.


Goals
--------

Add a kochab docs.md so a manual is generated for Kochab.

Also clean up content that refers to Rigel-specific functionality so it doesn't show up in the Kochab manual.

This should yield a Kochab manual that is not quite complete, but at least is accurate where chapters do exist.

Adding missing chapters (apart from the Kochab manual intro, etc) is NOT part of the scope of this task branch.


Test Plan
---------

Use `x.py build build-manuals` to build the Kochab manual and inspect it.
