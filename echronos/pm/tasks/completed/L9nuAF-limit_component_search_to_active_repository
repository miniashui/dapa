Task: L9nuAF-limit_component_search_to_active_repository
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------
x.py generates RTOS variants from multiple component files.
The code that searches for component files supports client repositories (i.e., multiple levels of repository-like parent directories containing component files of their own).
It does so by searching for, e.g., the file 'components/tasks.c' in the base directory and any parent directory.
This leads to unintended behaviour when x.py is invoked in the core repository and a component exists in a parent directory because in that case, the parent directories should be ignored.
This then leads to that component file being picked up and integrated into the RTOS variant that was supposed to be only generated from components of the core repository.


Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to address the above issue.
When searching for component files, only files shall be found that are in the repository/directory in which x.py was invoked or a child directory thereof.

Test Plan
---------

Code review
