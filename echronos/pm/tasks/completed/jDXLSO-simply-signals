Task: jDXLSO-simply-signals
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The goal of the task is to simplify the signal implementation.
This changes the interface so that signal_wait_set will now return all the signals, rather than just a single one.
Not only does this simplify the implementation, but also provides more flexibility to the user.

This shall also simplify the types; a SignalId will now be an alias for SignalSet (but shall imply that the set is singleton).
