Task: 1Unsmp-prj_error_message_about_missing_schema_sources
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

prj currently throws exceptions when an instance of the Module class has multiple or none of the three available schema source class members set.
This is not user friendly and difficult to debug because the Python file of the affected module is not part of the output and the class name may not be.

Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to raise an exception with a more helpful exception message which identifies the name of the affected module and the file it is contained in.

Test Plan
---------

This is a trivial change, so code review is considered sufficient.
