Task: PBFo04-change-component-order
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The current order of components has the 'variant' component first.
This doesn't work well if the component file defines structures based on structured defined in other components.
A full solution would be to automatically order structs correctly, however that is somewhat difficult.
Instead, as a work around, change the component order in x.py so that the variant component always comes last.
