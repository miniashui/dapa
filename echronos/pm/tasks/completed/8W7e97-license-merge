Task: 8W7e97-license-merge
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

When releasing a build to a customer it is important that the correct license is included.
This requires place an appropriate LICENSE.txt file in the top-level directory, and including an appropriate license header in each source code file.
In addition the build release process should be extended so that it can build multiple per customer releases.
