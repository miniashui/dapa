Task: DH6AEy-prj-genonly
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

When using the RTOS in other project is preferable to use the project's existing build system, rather than attempting to modify the project to use the `prj` build system.
The goal of this task is to add a 'generate' only target to the 'prj' tool.
This will just generate the file rather than performing any build.
No depedency on build tools should be required.
