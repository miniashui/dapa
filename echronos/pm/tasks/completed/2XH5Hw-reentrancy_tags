Task: 2XH5Hw-reentrancy_tags
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

On some platforms, compilers can apply optimizations to functions known to not be reentrant or recursive.
Since this information is currently not available for RTOS functions, such optimizations currently cannot be applied.


Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to tag reentrant and recursive functions as such.
This shall be done in a manner that is transparent to platforms where this information is irrelevant.

The declaration and definition of every reentrant or recursive function shall be augmented with the preprocessor macro `{{prefix_const}}REENTRANT` after the list of function parameters.
For example, `void {{prefix_func}}mutex_lock({{prefix_type}}MutexId);` shall be changed to `void {{prefix_func}}mutex_lock({{prefix_type}}MutexId) {{prefix_const}}REENTRANT;`.
The `{{prefix_const}}REENTRANT` macro shall be defined in an architecture component so that each architecture can define its value as appropriate.


Test Plan
---------

There is currently no automated check in place that could ensure the consistency of the reentrancy tags.
Thus, careful code review must ensure the correctness of the applied tags.
