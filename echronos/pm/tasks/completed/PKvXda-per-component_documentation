Task: PKvXda-per-component_documentation
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Manuals and documentation are currently generated from monolithic markdown files.
This leads to
- duplication of contents
- disconnect and hence inconsistencies between implementation and documentation


Goals
--------

- extend x.py such that it can collect 'documentation' sections in component files into a markdown file for each RTOS package, similar to how the implementation files of RTOS packages are generated

- as a proof of concept, break the monolithic neo rigel manual into its parts by component;
  integrate these parts into the documentation sections of the respective component files

- ensure that the generated markdown files contain the sections in an order that makes sense to a reader, i.e., sort them according to their dependencies

- extend the x.py build-manuals command such that it generates PDF versions of the generated markdown manuals of the RTOS packages

- add the necessary scaffolding and template files to generate reasonably appealing PDF


The following are not goals of this task:

- modifying the contents of the existing markdown documentation (e.g., to ensure correctness)

- improving the generation of the PDF or its layout


Test Plan
---------

- review changes

- run 'x.py build build-manuals' and ensure that it does not fail

- review the generated file packages/armv7m/rtos-rigel/documentation.pdf
