Task: 6rubAB-improve-error-reporting-on-ident
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

In some cases the improved schema checking does not provide a useful file location in the error message.
For example:

   ERROR:prj:Ident must only contains ASCII lower-case, digits and '_'

The goal of this is to ensure that correct location information is added to this error.
Additionally, other code paths should be evaluated to determine if similar under-reporting occurs.
