Task: TCRfXx-refactor_manuals_module
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The Python module pylib.manuals currently handles documentation in a relatively inconsistent manner:
- documentation is referred to as both 'docs' and 'manuals'
- documentation is built from a number of special-case files that are not part of any standard component
- the command to build documentation is redundantly called 'build build-manuals'


Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to resolve the inconsistencies listed above.


Test Plan
---------

- task branch must pass all existing regression tests
- generated documentation must not differ from documentation on 'development' branch
