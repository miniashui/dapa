Task: ULxvv5-handle-zero-mutexes
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to update rigel so that RTOS code is excluded where possible.
For example, if there are zero mutexes, the mutex code should be excluded.
The same approach applies to other objects, such as timers and interrupt events.
