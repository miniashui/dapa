Task: tJF3pU-c90_compatibility
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The code base of the core components currently implicitly adheres to the ISO9899:1990 / C90 / ANSI C standard.
However, this convention is neither documented nor tested.


Goals
--------

- document that and why the architecture independent components need to remain compatible with the ISO9899:1990 / C90 / ANSI C standard
- create a stub target architecture that allows to build all RTOS variants without any platform-dependent code
- set up the build module of the stub target architecture such that it enforces the use of the ANSI C standard;
  building RTOS variants for the stub architecture shall fail if any of the components contain code that does not adhere to the ANSI C standard.
- make sure that the regression test system successfully builds all RTOS variants for the stub architecture

Test Plan
---------

- must pass all existing and all new regression tests
- code review to check that all architecture-independent components are covered by at least one of the RTOS variants and test systems created for the stub target architecture
- code review to check that the build module for the stub architecture correctly enforces ANSI C standards compliance
