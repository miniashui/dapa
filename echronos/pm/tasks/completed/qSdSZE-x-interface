Task: qSdSZE-x-interface
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The ./x.py command line interface has grown organically over time. As such, it
can be confusing for a new developer trying to get up to speed. By simplifying
the interface developers will be better able to understand what the tool does
and to use it effectively.

Goals
--------
 - Simplify the x.py interface, by removing obsolete subcommands and grouping
   existing commands into logical groups
 - Update the documentation to ensure it is consistent with the implementation

Test Plan
---------
