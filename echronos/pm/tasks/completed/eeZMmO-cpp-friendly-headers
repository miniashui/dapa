Task: eeZMmO-cpp-friendly-headers
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

For users calling into the RTOS from C++, function declarations in the user API header need to be surrounded by an 'extern "C" { }' block dependent on #ifdef __cplusplus.

We can do this easily by adding a couple of lines of script to pylib/components.py that write the block opener and closer when it generates the 'public_function_definitions' section of the header.


Goals
--------

Have x.py put the public RTOS header's function declarations into a 'extern "C" { }' block when #ifdef __cplusplus.


Test Plan
---------

Existing regression tests, and inspect output header contents manually.
