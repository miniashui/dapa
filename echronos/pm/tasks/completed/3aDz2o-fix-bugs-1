Fix prj bugs (1)
=================

Goals
------

While using prj for development a number of bugs were found.

1. no startup script.
2. import doesn't search paths during init/startup
3. setting something to an empty string doesn't work.
4. FileNotFound error during header copying.
5. SystemBuildError should be handled and dealt with in a useful manner.
6. prj.py not executable.


Implementation Notes
--------------------

While implementing #2 discovered that additional errors should be caught, so these were additionally implemented.
