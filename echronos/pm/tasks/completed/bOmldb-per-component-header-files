Task: bOmldb-per-component-header-files
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The aim of this task is to allow components to contribute to the header files in the same way that they contribute to source files.
This will allow greater flexibility in the overall RTOS generation procedure.

In development of a solution to the above problem, a more general approach to simplify RTOS module generation was defined.
Rather than having individual templates x.py instead generates the whole source and header file based on a merging all the sections from all defined components.
TO achieve this the RTOS variant itself becomes a component and implements the necessary sections.

Some additional complexities with this approach that needed to be solved arise as previously the variant code interleaved some of the other components.
In particular there was careful work in the template to ensure that typedefs and static functions were defined in the correct order.
To avoid these problems static functions are now pre-declared, rather than relying on definition in the correct order.
To ensure the typedefs are output in the correct order these are explicitly sorted by x.py.
