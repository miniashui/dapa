Task: z7vFXX-rtos-critical-sections
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The goal of this is to intrdocue critical sections within the RTOS.
Prior to preemption this was not necessary, as all sections we critical sections if they did not contain yield.
The critical section will be flagged as "preempt_disable()" and "preempt_enable()" macros.
It will be the responsibility of the RTOS variant component to provide these function-like macros.
For the existing RTOS variants these will be no-ops, but for future variants these can be used to support preemptable kernels.
