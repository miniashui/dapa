Task: 30XA1a-add-pystache-formatting-chars
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Pystache performs replacement well, however there are sometimes cases where some minimal form of modification is desiraed.
For example, concerting a string to upper-case.
It would be useful to be able to perform these formatting changes direclty in the template, rather than requiring creating special attributes.
Inspired by Python's format specifiers approach, the proposal is that an (optional) formatter may be specified for variable interpolations.

For example:

    {{varname|formatter}}

A user of the library can register formatter with the library.

For example:

   renderer.register('u', string.upper)
   renderer.render('{{foo|u}}', {'foo': 'bar'})

Would output:

   'BAR'

Another approach would be to support the underlying Python __format__.

prj.py should be updated to use the functionality, specifically adding an upper-case ('u') formatter.
The current templates should be updated to take advatnage of this formatter so that macro names are craeted correctly.

Adding the feature to pystache provides an opportunity to simplify some of the pystache internals, and clean up some rought spots in the current implementation.
This opportunity has been taken to improve the overall quality of pystache.
