Task: mNEnaL-arm-kochab-fp-ctxt-switch
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Context switch of floating-point registers is not implemented for ARMv7-M, and is needed by users of Kochab on that platform.


Goals
--------

Implement context switch of ARMv7-M floating-point registers on the Kochab variant.


Test Plan
---------

Add a simple test system for machine-stm32f4-discovery that checks that the values of the floating point registers for tasks using the FPU are correctly preserved for those tasks across context switches.
