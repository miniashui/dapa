Task: icHGes-release-licensing
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------
Before releasing the RTOS we need to make sure that appropriate license files and headers are in place.
The code will be licnsed under AGPLv3.


Goals
--------
Add an overal LICENSE file that clarifies what is licensed under which license.
Also add files that code not copyright by us and that is available under a different license.
Finally add appropriate copyright and license headers to all relevant (source code and documentation) files.
Note that component files do not get a header as they will be composed together to form other files that will contain appropriate headers.


Test Plan
---------
Manually review that files contain appropriate headers.
Run regression tests to confirm that adding headers did not break anything.
