Task: g0JE2w-signal-names
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to allow the system designer to name signals.
Signal names will be a global name.
The overall schema will be:

    <signals>
     <signal>
       <name>...</name>
     </signal>
     ...
    </signals>

This will produce appropriately named SIGNAL_ID_<name> defines so that programmers need not hardcode signals.

Secondary goals
----------------

The initial signal implementation only provided version of functions that operated on full sets.
The original design called for helper functions (function-like macros) that operated on a single signal, rather than a full set.


   void signal_send(TaskId task_id, SignalId signal_id);
   bool signal_peek(SignalId signal_id);
   void signal_wait(SIgnalId signal_id);
   bool signal_poll(SignalId signal_id);

These work in conjunction with a macro SIGNAL_ID_TO_SET, which converts a SignalId to a singleton set.
