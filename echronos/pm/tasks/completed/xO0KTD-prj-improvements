Task: xO0KTD-prj-improvements
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

To support upcoming RTOS variants a number of short-comings of the existing prj were identified.
These are fixed together in a batch.

### ident vs c_ident

There are some things (specifically names) that we expect to have a certain format.
These should have a distinct type from the current `c_ident`.
This new type will be `ident` and shall be lower-case + digits + '_' only.

### Python code in module.

Newer RTOS variants will have more complexity and need to perform additional, specific, configuration fixups.
To support this an RTOS shall now be composed of a python module, c file and header.
The python file can then contain arbitrary configuration and code-generation rules.

### Improved base `Module` class.

In order to make it feasible for each RTOS variant to have Python code the base `Module` should be more powerful.
This means improving the base module to cover common cases and avoid duplication.

### Improved prj error checking.

As part of ongoing improvement the error checking in prj should be improved.

### Avoid `num_xxx`

It shouldn't be required for users to specify `num_xxx` as well as having a list of `xxx` items.
To support this the lists passed to configuration will be improved to have a `length` attribute.

### Avoid need for explicit `idx` field.

Currently there are various times where each item in a list needs an explicit <idx> item.
This should be automatically added (if the schema desires).
