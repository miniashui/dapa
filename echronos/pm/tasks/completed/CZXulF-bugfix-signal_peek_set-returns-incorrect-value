Task: CZXulF-bugfix-signal_peek_set-returns-incorrect-value
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The signal_peek_set() API is meant to return the intersection of a specified signal set and the currently pending signals.
However, the current implementatino returns the result of the signal_peek() macro which evaluates to a boolean value.
Therefore, signal_peek_set() does not return which of the requested signals are pending but only whether or not one of the requested signals was pending, encoded as a SignalSet type.


Goals
--------

- make signal_peek_set() provide the intended API semantics


Test Plan
---------

- code review
- existing regression tests must pass
