Task: oCfQVU-client-repositories
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

To protect the intellectual property of our clients, all client-specific code, configuration, documentation, and tooling needs to reside in client-specific repositories to be able to enforce access control.
Ideally, developing and using the RTOS in the core repository or in a client repository is very similar.

Goals
--------

- allow client repositories to integrate the RTOS core repository by including it as a sub-directory

- support that a wrapper in a client repository re-uses the x tool in the core repository and exposes the same interface


Test plan
---------

- the x tool must pass all tests
