Task: X8ZjKY-ppc-baseline
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

We'd like to port the RTOS to PowerPC and test it with QEMU emulation until boards can be obtained.


Goals
--------

Add support to build PowerPC binaries that run on QEMU, assuming a locally installed `powerpc-linux-gnu` cross-compiler toolchain, obtainable via apt.
Implement very basic context switch (only storing general-purpose registers), and show it works via the existing, unmodified acamar-system test.


Test Plan
---------

Exercise build with `./x.py acamar-gen`, and use prj to build modules ppc.example.hello and ppc.example.acamar-system.
Run on qemu-ppc with GDB attached, and a breakpoint set at debug_println.
GDB can be built from source after configuring with `./configure --target=powerpc-linux-gnu`.
