Task: 9BXmof-sem-max-init
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

On a customer project, semaphore limits are configured and checked against by the user at runtime to help the system designer assert that the maximum isn't exceeded.
At the time this required hacks to expose semaphore implementation internals.

Instead, we would like to optionally allow the user to initialize the semaphore maximum so that the RTOS can trigger a fatal error if the user ever posts past it.
This API should be optional in the sense that if it is not required, the associated code should be compiled out and not take up any extra image space.

Incidentally, on that same customer project we need a semaphore width greater than the one currently hardcoded by simple-semaphore, and making this configurable via the XML is rather straightforward and will grant better flexibility.


Goals
--------

Add an optional API that supports runtime configuration of semaphore limits that cause a fatal error if exceeded.
Also enable the semaphore value width to be configurable via the .prx file.


Test Plan
---------

Enable sem_max_init API for and add a test case to sem-max-demo that triggers a fatal error by posting too much.
Existing regression tests should ensure I didn't break anything on systems that don't use sem_max_init.
