Task: 2niYih-doc-license-scripts
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Documentation files committed to the repository have AGPL license headers tagged 'NICTA_DOC_AGPL'.
However, the x.py release scripts currently ignore documentation file types.
At the very least, x.py needs to strip these for customer releases, and preferably we can also replace them with a per-release license header.

Furthermore, './x.py test licenses' needs to check the AGPL header is present in documentation files.
It should also catch and fail on unknown filetypes, which it isn't currently doing.


Goals
--------

Ensure x.py strips AGPL license headers from documentation when building releases.

Make sure license check (./x.py test licenses) also checks documentation files.

While we're here, we can fix any other minor outstanding issues with the release scripts and the license check.


Test Plan
---------

Run './x.py test licenses' with files modified so the AGPL headers are missing, and make sure they're caught.

Build releases with custom release license strings and manually check that everything has the licenses expected, and that documentation files (.html, .markdown) render correctly with the generated license headers inserted.
