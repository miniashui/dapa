Task: t7Kb5l-rename_x_commands
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Many commands of the x.py utility currently have inconsistent or repetitive names, such as "x.py build build-partials" or "x.py test check-pep8".
This makes the x.py utility unnecessarily confusing and annoying to use.


Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to give all commands consistent and intuitive names.
As a part of this effort, the code for handling command line parsing may be refactored so that it is easier to maintain.


Test Plan
---------

The existing regression tests need to be updated to match the name changes.
They are otherwise considered sufficient to show the correctness of the changes.
