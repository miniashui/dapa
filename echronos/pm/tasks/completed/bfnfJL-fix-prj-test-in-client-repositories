Task: bfnfJL-fix-prj-test-in-client-repositories
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The command 'x.py prj-test' currently fails when run from a client repository.
The goal of this task is to fix this failure.
The failure is due to x.py not setting up the Python path such that the prj module can be found and imported in the function run_module_tests().
The proposed fix is to not discover and run tests when the directories do not exist with which the Python path is to be extended.
The rationale is that a test setup is tied to a certain directory and module structure.
If that structure is not present in a repository, there is no point in attempting to run the test setup.

Test plan
---------
Run the commands 'x.py prj-test' and 'x.py x-test' in the core and in a client repository.
In the core repository, the prj-test and x-test commands shall behave as on the development branch.
In client repositories, the prj-test and x-test commands shall only lead to the execution of tests if these client repositories contain the test target.
For the prj-test command, this would usually not be the case so no tests should be run and no errors should be reported.
