Task: LaaR3C-improved-signal-labels
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The aim of this branch is to improve the way in which signal labels are defined and used in the rigel variant.
The signal_label configuration item will be extended with configuration fields to describe which tasks the label is applicable too.
It shall be possible to either list tasks individually, or specify all tasks.

Additionally, existing configuration items that refer to signal sets with a raw value, shall be changed to use names instead.
