Task: Wq3mjc-message_queue_assertions
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The current implementation of the message queue API does not contain any API or internal assertions.
Thus, a wide range of consistency checks is not performed which can substantially simplify failure analysis and debugging.


Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to extend the message queue implementation with API and internal assertions.
These assertions shall check both potential mistakes in using the API and internal consistency of the message queue state.


Test Plan
---------

The assertions shall be closely scrutinized for correctness.
They shall also be tested at runtime via an example rigel system.
This system may be a temporary out-of-tree system as the framework does currently not permit to implement runtime regression tests against rigel systems in rtos-core.
