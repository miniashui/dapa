Task: 2hejdO-x-release-support
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Provide support in x.py for creating releases.
A release will include a number of packages, and the prj tool binary.
As the prj tool tool binary is clearly platform dependent this imposes some intersting constraints.
The approach is that a number if partial archive files will be generated, and then, using TeamCity, package file generated on different machines will be merged together.
The partial releases will be generated in to `release/partial`.

The current approach to generating rtos has been to place them in single packages.
This will be changed such that generated RTOSes will be modules that exist within the relevant architecture package.
For examples armv7m/rtos-acamar.
This reduces what would otherwise be a large explosion of packages, which would make maintenence difficult.
A consequence is that form a product management perspective a customer would (by default) receive all RTOS configurations as part of a release.
This is deemed acceptable from a product management point of view.
To assist in this change, it will likely be necessary to refactor the current examples directory to be more consistent.
