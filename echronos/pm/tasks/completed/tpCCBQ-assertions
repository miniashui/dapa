Task: tpCCBQ-assertions
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The aim of this task is to add a set of assertions to the RTOS implementation.
The assertions will either be 'api_asserts' or 'internal_asserts'.
The API asserts are designed to find usage errors.
The internal asserts are designed to protect against (detect) bugs in the RTOS.
Both sets of asserts will be configurable from the system PRX file.
