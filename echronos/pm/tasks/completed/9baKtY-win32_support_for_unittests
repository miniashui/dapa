Task: 9baKtY-win32_support_for_unittests
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The support for unit testing in x.py is currently limited to MacOSX.
Since MacOSX is not available to some developers, and in particular not to the current regression test system, this leaves a gap in the RTOS test coverage.


Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to close the gap in unit test coverage by supporting unit testing on Windows.
Linux would be the preferred platform to support because it forms the basis for the rest of the regression test system and release management.
However, the unit test framework depends on the Python ctypes module which is not available in the Python interpreter distributed with the RTOS.
Thus, gaining support for unit tests requires a relatively large amount of effort since that Python interpreter needs to be rebuilt.
This is not necessary under Windows, where the system Python interpreter is used.
Furthermore, Windows also supported by the current regression test system and thus also help close the gap in the regression test coverage.

Individual goals of this task are:

- the prj tool shall be able to build the unit test systems

- the x tool shall be able to execute the unit tests such that they are usable for regression testing

- limitations and restrictions shall be documented and, ideally, checked for by the relevant tools

- the regression test system shall be reconfigured to run the unit tests on Windows as part of the rest of all regression tests and these tests shall pass


Test Plan
---------

- review the configuration of the regression test system (TeamCity) and verify that the unit tests are executed on Windows

- review the test results and verify that the unit tests pass

- review the source code changes and verify that they meet the RTOS quality standards
