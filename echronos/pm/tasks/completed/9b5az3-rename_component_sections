Task: 9b5az3-rename_component_sections
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Component files, such as implementation.c, header.h, or docs.md consist of several section, each section with a specific name identifying the contents of the section.
These section names are, in part, poorly chosen.
For example, the name `function_definitions` is incorrect as the intended section contents are not function definitions but function declarations.


Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to rename the sections so that their names are correct, consistent, intuitive.


Test Plan
---------

- code review
- existing regression tests are sufficient
