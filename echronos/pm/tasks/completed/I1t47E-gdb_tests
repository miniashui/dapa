Task: I1t47E-gdb_tests
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

There is currently no support for system tests in the repository.
In particular, the repository contains a range of test and example systems that can be built for various target platforms but not executed and tested for regressions via a common test infrastructure.


Goals
--------

- create a test command and infrastructure in the x.py tool that allows to run and test systems
- for the purpose of this task, 'testing' means that (where supported) systems shall be attached to gdb and executed based on a given gdb command file;
  the gdb output shall be compared against a pre-recorded output file and the test shall succeed only if the two outputs match;
  some output filtering will need to be applied
- the added infrastructure shall not be specific to this test setup;
  it shall be based on nose and support any Python-based test, such as testing systems live on target platform hardware;
  it shall eventually be able to integrate the existing but currently defunct unit tests;
  the introduced directory structure shall be easy to understand and keep files related to a test close to each other instead of spread out across the repository


Test Plan
---------

- code review
- run `x.py test systems` and verify that it does not indicate any test failures
