Task: fjvQZt-x-allow-unknown-filetypes
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

x.py build build-partials currently disallows any files of unknown file extension when building partial release files.

Since build-partials is set as the <startup-script> in the project.prj given with the repo, this is moderately inconvenient when developing code in the packages directory with editors that create .swp and ~ files.
When you try to build systems using prj tool directly in the repo, it throws an exception complaining about the existence of these files.

However, we would like to keep the restriction in the default case because we don't want any new and weird file types getting into any releases without a well-defined license check.


Goals
--------

Add an optional argument to build-partials that relaxes the filetype restriction, and use it for the <startup-script> invocation of build-partials in project.prj.


Test Plan
---------

Create editor artifacts (or any other files with unknown type) in the packages directory and try to build systems with prj tool directly in the repo - these should work.

Then, with the editor artifacts still present, try to run x.py build build-partials - this should fail as before.

Pass existing regression tests.
