Task: Jx16x3-kochab-timer
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Kochab will need to have timer support in order to implement timeouts for mutex_lock and sem_wait.
We don't mind expanding Kochab's functionality to offer a timer API, so this just means adding the timer component for all platforms that support Kochab.

Particularly, implementing a sleep() API for Kochab will set up the internal task timer support that will be necessary for the mutex/semaphore timeout support.
Currently, 'sleep' is a RTOS variant-specific API only offered by Rigel.


Goals
--------

Add timer APIs to Kochab on all platforms, including internal task timer support exercised by a sleep API.


Test Plan
---------

Add a test system for Kochab that exercises, at the very least, the new sleep API.
