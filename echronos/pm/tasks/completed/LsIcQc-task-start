Task: LsIcQc-task-start
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Add a task_start API to the rigel RTOS.
A task can be automatically started, or only started after another task call "task_start".
The design is that each task that isn't automatically started will block waiting on a signal.
The implementation of "task_start" will simply send the appropriate signal to the task.
This task will add the "start" configuration option to each task.
