Task: OTSg8d-fix-freestanding-test-release
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The x.py command test-release currently works only if invoked in a directory containing the build artifacts from creating a release.
When invoked on a release tar-ball only, it fails.
The goal of this task is to ensure that the test-release command correctly tests a release tar-ball, even in otherwise clean rtos-core repositories.

Test plan
---------
Create an rtos release:
#> . setenv
#> ./x.py build-partials
#> ./x.py prj-build
#> ./x.py build-release

Keep only the release tar-ball
#> rm -fr release/partials
#> mv release ../
#> git clean -xdf
#> mv ../release ./

Test the release
#> ./x.py test-release

The x tool must exit with the exit code 0 and must not report any errors.
It must successfully extract the release tar-ball(s) and build the contained systems.
