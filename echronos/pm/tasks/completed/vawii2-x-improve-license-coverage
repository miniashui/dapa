Task: vawii2-x-improve-license-coverage
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

A couple of license release/test coverage issues for the x.py tool:

x.py does not check and replace license headers for files specified via the 'extra_files' variable of a release configuration, which may be coming from outside of the 'packages' directory structure.

Furthermore, the x.py license test exempts the whole of the 'components' directory.
We should only be exempting those files (.c, .h, .xml, .md) that are code/header/schema/docs fragments intended for composition by x.py into RTOS modules/manuals.


Goals
--------

Make 'x.py build build-release' correctly handle license headers in 'extra_files' when inserting them into a release.

Make 'x.py test licenses' exempt only 'component fragment' file types in the 'components' directory.


Test Plan
---------

Manually change the license string for a release and ensure 'extra_files' like the top-level release README.md have their license header replaced with the release one.

Should pass 'x.py test licenses' as part of the existing regression suite.
