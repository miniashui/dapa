Task: GAEBYc-rigel_zero_element_compile_fix_irq_event
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The previous attempted fix for allowing zero interrupt events was flawed as important system specific code relies on calling interrupt_event_process.
The goal of this task is to fix this, and consider a different approach.
