Task: zmPPJH-task_component
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The RTOS variant components (acamar.py, acrux.py, etc.) contain a lot of duplicate code.
It covers fundamental task-related code, such as task IDs and contexts.
This duplication makes it difficult to maintenance this code and create new variants.


Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to avoid this duplication.
To meet this goal, the common code shall be moved into a reusable task component.
Other reusable components shall be created as necessary.
It is acceptable that the code or configuration of the individual RTOS variants is modified slightly if it is necessary to reduce code duplication.


Test Plan
---------

This is an overall change to how RTOS variants are generated that cannot be tested specifically.
Reviewers shall inspect the generated RTOS variant modules (i.e., the rtos-<variant>.[ch] files) before and after this task and verify that the differences have no detrimental impact on released RTOS code.
All existing regression tests must pass.
