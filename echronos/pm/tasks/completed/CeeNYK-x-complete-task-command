Support task completion in x.py
===============================

Goals
------

The x tool shall automate the actions necessary to complete a development task.
These actions are:

- Check whether the branch has been reviewed and if the most recent review from each individual reviewer contains the 'Accepted' verdict.
  If that is not the case, x.py shall inform the user and abort.

- The task branch shall be merged into the 'development' branch.

- On the 'development' branch, the task description shall be moved into the pm/tasks/completed/ directory

- The task branch shall be moved into the 'archive/' directory.
  (In git terms, the task branch shall be renamed with the prefix 'archive/', pushed to the server, and the original task branch shall be deleted from the server).

The x tool shall implement these actions under a new command.
The command shall accept the following options for flexibility:

- the task name, implying the branch name and the name of the task description file, defaulting to the active branch if the working directory is a git repository

- the target branch to merge the task branch into, defaulting to 'development'

- the prefix for renaming the branch, defaulting to 'archive/'
