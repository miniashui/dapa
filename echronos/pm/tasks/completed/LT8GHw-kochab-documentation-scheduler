Task: LT8GHw-kochab-documentation-scheduler
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

No chapter exists in the Kochab user manual for Preemption and the Scheduling Algorithm (sched-prio-inherit).

There is also content in the Kochab manual that refers to non-preemptive systems, but Kochab is preemptive.


Goals
--------

Add missing user documentation for Preemption and the Scheduling Algorithm to the manual of the Kochab variant.

Strip or block out information regarding non-preemptive systems from preemptive variants, and vice versa.


Test Plan
---------

./x.py build build-manuals

Inspect the manual... manually.
