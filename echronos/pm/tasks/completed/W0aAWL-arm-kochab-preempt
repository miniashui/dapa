Task: W0aAWL-arm-kochab-preempt
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

A preemption mechanism for ARMv7-M was initially introduced to the core development head by gSSH9b-core-arm-preemption.

Building on the original preemption mechanism, the Kochab RTOS variant was prototyped on branch lLGoAN-kochab-rtos-variant and distributed to NICTA for use by the SMACCM project.

Later, Benno reimplemented the ARMv7-M preemption mechanism to use the PendSV exception, which resolved some issues encountered during SMACCM development.

Merging this preemption mechanism back into the RTOS core repository will allow the Kochab variant to be built for ARMv7-M, and a big step closer to eliminating the divergence between the RTOS core repository and the SMACCM development head.


Goals
--------

Merge back the redesigned PendSV-based ARMv7-M preemption mechanism for Kochab from the SMACCM development head, allowing the Kochab variant to be built for ARMv7-M.

See `pm/tasks/completed/ZbYV9R-ppc-kochab-preempt` for the requirements for Kochab's task preemption behaviour.


Test Plan
---------

Add test systems for machine-qemu-simple that run the existing Kochab mutex, signal, and semaphore demo programs.

Also add a new test program and system for the task preemption functionality to run on machine-qemu-simple, matching the behaviour of the existing 'kochab-system' for machine-qemu-ppce500.

A current limitation to testing Kochab after the introduction of this feature is that the BASEPRI mechanism on machine-qemu-simple does not appear to work correctly.
Therefore, running any of the above test programs on machine-qemu-simple will likely result in fatal errors during runtime due to violated internal post/preconditions.

Instead, all Kochab programs will now be built for and tested on machine-stm32f4-discovery.
Incidentally, the Kochab demo images built for machine-stm32f4-discovery will also run without modification on the ARMV7-M hardware used by the SMACCM project.
Fixing machine-qemu-simple or adding support for new hardware is not within the scope of this feature.
