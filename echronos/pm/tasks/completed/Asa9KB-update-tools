Task: Asa9KB-update-tools
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The current tools require a very modern version of GLIBC on the Linux platform.
The xyz tool has been updated to generate tools that only depend on GLIBC 2.11.
This task should install the new tools, then test and verify correct behaviour on a number of Linux platforms.

To verify that the new tools work correctly a skeleton release build script should be added and integrated with TeamCity.
