Task: IjyvMF-arm-ext-irq-config
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

There currently exists a pystache stub in the armv7m vectable.s that would populate the vector table with handler addresses for exception numbers 16..255, which is the region for external IRQs.
However, there's currently no XML schema nor scripting to actually allow them to be supplied via the .prx file.

We have an implementation for this on the SMACCM development head ready to be backported, along with some more up-to-date user documentation for the armv7m.vectable module.


Goals
--------

Enable .prx configuration of vector table entries for external IRQs on armv7m systems.

Bring the armv7m.vectable module documentation up to date, as it is currently missing a lot of detail.


Test Plan
---------

Add a test system whose .prx file exercises the new configuration interface.
