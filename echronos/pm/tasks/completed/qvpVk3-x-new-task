Task: qvpVk3-x-new-task
=========================

Goals
------

Add a 'new-task' command to the x script.
New task should do the following:

    generate a tag (and full branch name)
    create a local branch
    create a remote branch
    associate local with remote branch
    create a new pm/tasks/<task_name> file from a template.

Although considered, it is not necessary/desired that the script automatically adds/commits/pushees the task description file.
