Task: RjCjbe-priority-scheduler-inherit
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Implement a priority scheduler that supports inheritance.
Inheritance allows a task to 'block on' a specific task, rather than simply 'blocking'.
When a task 'blocks on' another task (the 'blocker') that blocker will be scheduled instead of the original task.
In a priority scheduler this will implement the standard priority inheritance protocol.
