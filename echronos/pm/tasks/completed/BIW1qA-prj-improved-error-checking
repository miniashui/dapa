Task: BIW1qA-prj-improved-error-checking
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

There are some aspects of the current prj tool where user supplied inputs are not well checked.
The goal of this task is to improve prj's error checking so more cases are handled cleanly, with appropriate feedback to the user.

It is not anticipated that this task will capture all possible user errors.
The task's goal will be achieved if the error checked is improved; it need not be perfect.

Specific areas to improve include:

If a user supplied Python module raises an unexpected exception this should not cause prj to crash.
Instead a traceback should be saved for the user and an appopriate error message provided.

If a user specificies a schema object in a python module, and that schema is invalid, an unexpected error will occur when attempting to parse the configuration.
Instead the schema validity should be checked, and an appropriate error raise before configuration occurs.
