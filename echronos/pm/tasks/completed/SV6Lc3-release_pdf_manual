Task: SV6Lc3-release_pdf_manual
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

When building a release, the generated release archive currently does not necessarily include the PDF manual of the released RTOS variants.
However, it does contain the image and markdown files that are compiled into the PDF manual.
Also, the name of the PDF manual is 'docs.pdf' is not very descriptive and it can be difficult for users to find the manual in the release archive.


Goals
--------

- ensure that release archives contain no other documentation files than PDF manuals
- include the PDF manuals in the release archives under names that reflect the release information


Test Plan
---------

- code review
- review of task goals:
    #> xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 640x480x16" ./x.py build docs
    #> ./x.py build prj-build
    #> ./x.py build build-partials
    #> ./x.py build build-release
    #> for F in release/*.tar.gz; do tar taf $F; done | grep -e '/docs'
       shall terminate with the exit code 1 and produce no output
    #> for F in release/*.tar.gz; do tar taf $F; done | grep '.pdf'
       shall terminate with the exit code 0 and produce one or more lines of the pattern <produc_name>-<release_name>/<product_name>-<release_name>-<variant>-<version>.pdf on stdout
