Task: oNBHyO-extend-prj-xml-includes
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

When parsing system definitions, the prj tool resolves XML 'include' elements by including the referenced file.
The goal of this task is to make prj support nested inclusions.
Thus, if a system definition has an include element referring to file A which in turn contains an include element referring to file B, the resulting XML DOM shall include A and B.
The path of B shall be interpreted relative to A, not the main system definition.

Paths of files to include, as specified by the 'file' attribute in an 'include' element, are evaluated relative to the path of the file containing the 'include' element.
The second goal of this task is to resolve paths additionally relative to a configurable set of "include paths".
The prj tool shall attempt paths according to the following logic:
- If the 'file' path is absolute, include the referenced file.
- If the 'file' path is relative, interpret it relative to the path of the file containing the 'include' element.
  If such a file exists, include it.
  If no such file exists, interpret the 'file' path relative to each of the paths in the configured set of include paths.
  The first file existing with such a path shall be included.

Test plan
---------

A unit test must be added that exercises nested includes.
