Task: mPqfai-remove_manual_logo
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

RTOS manuals are generated including the logo of Breakaway Consulting Pty. Ltd.
The logo is currently in the repository from where it would become part of the open-source release.
It is currently considered undesirable that manuals generated from the open-source release also include that logo.

Goals
--------

- remove the logo from the repository
  (the fact that the logo remains in the repository's history is acceptable)

Test Plan
---------

- check that the logo file is no longer in the repository
- check that the manuals can still be generated correctly, but without the logo
