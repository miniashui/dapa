Task: JaJV00-static_mutex_initialization
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The blocking-mutex component currently initializes its data structures dynamically at run time.
This has two drawbacks compared to static initialization:
- it requires code space
- the compiler for the c251 architecture has a defect that leads to an incorrect warning about the initialization loops of length one, which could be avoided

The goal of this task is to replace the dynamic with static data initialization in the blocking-mutex component.
