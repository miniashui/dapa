Task: ZrEB0v-per-component_config_schemas
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Currently, the configuration schema of an RTOS variant is defined in the variant's Python module (e.g., in components/acamar.py).
This approach has two main downsides:

* Non-locality of changes:
  When adding, modifying, or deleting a configuration item in a component, the Python modules of all RTOS variants including that component need to be updated as well.
  This is particularly problematic when the modified component is managed in a client repository, but the RTOS Python module needs to be updated in rtos-core.

* Duplication:
  The configuration schema of a component needs to be present in the Python module of each RTOS variant that includes the component.
  This also makes it more difficult than necessary to maintain a consistent RTOS implementation.

Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to alleviate the above downsides of central configuration schemas.

The proposed approach is to store the configuration schema of each component in the component implementation file.
x.py shall be extended to collect the configuration schema fragments of all components going into an RTOS variant.
The collected fragments shall then be merged into a single configuration schema that shall be equivalent to the one currently stored in the variant's Python module.


Test Plan
---------

In addition to code review, review an RTOS release before and after this task;
they must match.
