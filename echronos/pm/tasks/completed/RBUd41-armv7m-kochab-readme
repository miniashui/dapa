Task: RBUd41-armv7m-kochab-readme
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

While preparing a project partner release, I wrote a new top-level release README.md for Kochab on ARMv7-M, based on the existing Rigel one.

This might be somewhat useful to keep because I fixed up some stale/confusing content, and furthermore added sections describing the 'armv7m.ctxt-switch-preempt' and 'armv7m.exception-preempt' modules, which were otherwise undocumented.

Those descriptions might also be better off migrated to the (somewhat bare) armv7m-manual.md package documentation file.

Finally, we should probably switch over to using this Kochab-oriented release README for the default ARM release, to be consistent with the default PowerPC release which emphasizes Kochab.


Goals
--------

Commit new ARMv7-M Kochab release README, migrate content from it to armv7m package documentation if it makes sense.

Switch the default ARM release over to using the Kochab-oriented release README rather than the Rigel one.


Test Plan
---------

Existing regression tests.
