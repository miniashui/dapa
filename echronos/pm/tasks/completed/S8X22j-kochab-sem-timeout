Task: S8X22j-kochab-sem-timeout
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The SMACCM use case for the Kochab variant requires a timeout version of semaphore_wait.
Newly added timer support for Kochab makes it possible to implement this using a oneshot internal task timer, in the same way that the timeout versions of message queue APIs are implemented on Rigel.

While we're making changes here, the SMACCM use case also needed to expose SEM_ID_ZERO and SEM_ID_MAX.
This is just a trivial fix to the simple-semaphore header that would make us consistent with already exposing MUTEX_ID_ZERO and MUTEX_ID_MAX in the RTOS user API.


Goals
--------

Implement a timeout version of sem_wait available on Kochab using the existing timer framework.

Trivially fix the semaphore API to be consistent with the mutex API by defining SEM_ID_ZERO and SEM_ID_MAX publicly.


Test Plan
---------

Add a test case to kochab-sem-demo that exercises the new sem_wait_timeout API.
