Task: DBvQ3H-pystache-error-checking
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Determine a design and implementation for improving the way in which pystache handles errors.
Right now when an error occurs it is very difficult to determine the exact problem.
Providing a file:line.col style debug information would make things easier for the user.
