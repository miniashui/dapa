Task: eBiX0B-add_provenance_information
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The RTOS repository contains a number of external, third-party files.
The origin, copyright, and licensing is currently not consistently documented.
However, this information may be necessary to satisfy legal and compliance requirements, in particular when releasing and distributing the RTOS.

Goals
--------

- document the origin, copyright, and license of all third-party code and tools in the RTOS repository
- use an approach that is reasonably easy to maintain and test for regressions

Test Plan
---------

- manual review of added provenance information
- run regression tests and check that they succeed
