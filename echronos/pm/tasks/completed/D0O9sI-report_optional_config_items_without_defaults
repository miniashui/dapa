Task: D0O9sI-report_optional_config_items_without_defaults
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

When the prj tool processes an optional system configuration element without a default value, it aborts with a generic Python exception.
This makes it difficult to determine the configuration element at fault.
The goal of this task is to make this type of issue easier to debug.
The approach is to check whether every optional system configuration element has a default value and to report the affected element if a default value is missing.

Scope change:
PRX schema elements have an implied default value of None.
The correct approach for this task is to fix the code that leads to the KeyError exception when querying the schema element for a default value that hasn't been explicitly specified.
It should return None in this case.
