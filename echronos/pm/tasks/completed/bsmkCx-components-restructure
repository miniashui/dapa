Task: bsmkCx-components-restructure
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Components are currently defined in a components/*.c.
These files contain templated C code, documentation and XML snippets in sectioned blocks.
As the complexity of components increases, this format is no longer ideal and needs to be updated to something more practical.

Goals
--------

For each component create a directory within components/ and then break out the contents of the .c files into a number of separate files.

components/<name>/implementation.c.stache.stache
                 /header.h.stache.stache
                 /schema.xml
                 /documentation.md
                 /<extra files>

The output of the composition step will result in slightly different filenames.

packages/<arch>/rtos-<name>/rtos-<name>.c.stache
                           /rtos-<name>.h.stache
                           /schema.xml
                           /documentation.md
                           /entity.py
                           /<extra files>

The .stache suffix is being added to files to indicate that they must be run through pystache before they can be considered a valid .[c|h] file.

Test Plan
---------

All existing tests on TeamCity will pass on both the RTOS core and clr-rtos projects.
A corresponding task will be created on the clr-rtos project to make the appropriate changes to the clr-specific components.
