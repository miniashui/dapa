Task: W44OOP-ppc-kochab-prelim
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

We want to bring up kochab on PowerPC but kochab is not yet in the development head.
The introduction of kochab in smaller chunks will make it easier to review.
This first task will just feature kochab's support for mutexes, semaphores and signals with a priority inheritance
scheduler and implied yield-on-unblock semantics, but without irqs or preemption, which are arch-dependent.
The introduction of interrupts and preemption for arm and ppc can then be done in separate tasks.


Goals
--------

Introduce a cut-down 'kochab' variant with kochab's non-interrupt-dependent features as a base step for bringing
kochab into mainline.
Also provide test programs for that functionality.


Test Plan
---------

New rtos-example programs kochab-mutex-demo, kochab-sem-demo and kochab-signal-demo will test the expected behaviour
of those primitives in the presence of priority scheduling with inheritance.
