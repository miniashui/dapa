Task: AUOPF4-add-interrupt_event_task_set-api
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The handler task of an interrupt event is currently configured statically.
This is a limiting factor for applications which need to dynamically change the handler task for an interrupt event.
For example, a driver might want to hand off the handling of an input event to the task that requested the input.

Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to remove above limitation for applications.
Specifically, the goal is to implement the RTOS API void interrupt_event_task_set(InterruptEventId, TaskId).
It shall set the handler task for the given interrupt event to the given task at runtime.

Test plan
---------

Due to the simplicity of the change, code review shall be sufficient.
