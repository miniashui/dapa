Task: CN8WgX-change-entity-name-to-dots
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Currently entity names are separated by '/'.
This causes a number of interesting problems when considering entity name vs paths, especially on Windows.
This branch should change all entities to be named using '.' as the separator.
'/' and '\' will be illegal characters in entity names.

Notes
---------

In effecting the goals of the task a number of other related aspects regarding module naming were considered.
Specifically, during testing the changes, it was revealed that there is no reliable way to convert path names to entity names.

The design for specifying systems on the command line has been improved to remove ambiguity and increase reliability.
When using the 'gen' command, systems are specified by path only, and the output directory defaults to '.'
When using 'build' or 'load' commands, systems must be specified by name, and the existing defaults apply.
