Task: UVt8Rw-irq-event
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to add support for an IRQ event RTOS component.
This will provide the bridge between the *interrupt* and *task* world.
As well as the low-level component, a new RTOS that uses it should be created, along with a suitable test system.
