Task: EEZgAz-fix_executable_reference_in_unit_tests
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

When running the unit tests on Windows, they currently fail due to a linker failure.
The cause of this failure is that, while building the unit test system, the linker cannot write the system.exe file.
This is in turn caused by the system.exe file still executing as part of the previous unit test.
The specific tests are simple_semaphore.testSimpleSemaphore.test_simple() (last one succeeding) and simple_semaphore.testSimpleSemaphoreWhiteBox.test_block() (first one failing).
Theoretically, the two different test classes (testSimpleSemaphore and testSimpleSemaphoreWhiteBox) do not share any resources.
However, they share the same base class through which they also share a reference to the same ctypes instance.
This is why the executable is still executing when the testSimpleSemaphoreWhiteBox test cases are run.

Goals
--------

- avoid the linker error and make the unit tests run to completion

Test Plan
---------

#> x.py rtos-test
