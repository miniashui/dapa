Task: nGdHLz-build-prj-binary
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

We want to distribute `prj` as an executable, rather than a set of python scripts.
To do this the `ice` tool will be used: https://github.com/BreakawayConsulting/ice
x.py will have a new command `prj-build` that will create the `prj` binary.
