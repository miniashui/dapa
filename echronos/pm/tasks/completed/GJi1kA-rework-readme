Task: GJi1kA-rework-readme
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The top-level README file is out of date and is more targeted towards internal users.

We need to rework this so that it targets external parties coming across the code base for the first time via GitHub.

We might also need to add something that describes how external parties can contribute to the RTOS.


Goals
--------

Rework the top-level README so it is adequately informative for external parties accessing the repo via GitHub.

Add a notice explaining the process for external parties to contribute to the RTOS.


Test Plan
---------

Manual review.
