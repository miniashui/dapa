Task: PjCpMx-fix-release-test-directory
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The x command test-release fails.
It attempts to perform its tests in an incorrect directory.
When it extracts the release tar balls under test, it does not change into the top-level extracted directory.
Thus, it cannot execute the contained prj tool which leads to the error message "sh: 1: ./x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/prj: not found".
It also does not convert the old-style path-based system names into the new, dotted notation which leads to error messages such as "ERROR:prj:System name 'machine-qemu-simple/example/kraz-system' is invalid."

The goal of this task is to fix this issue.

Test plan
---------
Create a release:

#> . setenv
#> ./x.py prj-build
#> ./x.py build-partials
#> ./x.py build-release

Remove all build artefacts except the release files:

#> mv release ../
#> git clean -fxd
#> mv ../release ./

Execute the release tests and ensure that it does not report that prj could not be executed or that the build target system (specified with a path-based name) could not be found.

#> ./x.py test-release

It is known that this command still fails which shall be resolved in a different task.
