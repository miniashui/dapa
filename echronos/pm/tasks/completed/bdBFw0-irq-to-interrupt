Task: bdBFw0-irq-to-interrupt
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The acronym IRQ means interrupt request line.
As such an 'interrupt request line' event doesn't really make much sense.
Change instances of 'irq_event' => 'interrupt_event'.
