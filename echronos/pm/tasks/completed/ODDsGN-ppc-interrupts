Task: ODDsGN-ppc-interrupts
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

We want RTOS variants with interrupt-related features to be able to configure and make use of interrupts on PowerPC.


Goals
--------

Implement vector table and interrupt events on PowerPC and show they work via an adaptation of the existing acrux-test.
Also develop support for projects to specify their own interrupt handlers via the .prx file.


Test Plan
---------

Use x.py to build the SMACCM PPC release, and use prj to build module ppc.example.acrux-system.
Run on qemu-ppc with GDB attached, and breakpoints set at debug_println, tick_irq, and interrupt_event_wait.
