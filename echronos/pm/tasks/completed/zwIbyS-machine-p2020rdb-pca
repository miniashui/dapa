Task: zwIbyS-machine-p2020rdb-pca
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

We previously brought up all existing variants (minus Rigel and Phact) on the PowerPC e500 as emulated by QEMU.

A customer wants the RTOS working on a board based on the P2020 chip, which features dual e500 processor cores.
The RTOS is only required to run on core 0.

In order to support the customer going forward we would like to bring up the RTOS on the Freescale P2020RDB-PCA, which is an evaluation board also based on the P2020 chip.

Due to project requirements, we would also like the Phact variant to work on this board.


Goals
--------

Addition of a new package, machine-p2020rdb-pca, for the Freescale P20202RDB-PCA board.

All RTOS variant example systems currently running on machine-qemu-ppce500 ported to machine-p2020rdb-pca and running booted with U-Boot 'bootelf'.

Additionally, all Phact test systems currently running on machine-stm32f4-discovery ported to run on machine-p2020rdb-pca, also booted with U-Boot 'bootelf'.


Test Plan
---------

Build system images in ELF format using prj.py build.

Use the stock U-Boot firmware on the P2020RDB-PCA to load images via 'tftpboot' and run them with 'bootelf':

    tftpboot path/to/img.elf
    interrupts off
    bootelf
