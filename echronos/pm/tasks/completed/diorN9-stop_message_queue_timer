Task: diorN9-stop_message_queue_timer
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

There is a timeout-related performance issue in the current implementation of the message queue component.
This issue can occur when an application uses the message_queue_put_timeout() or message_queue_get_timeout() API functions.
These functions start a timer but may return before the timer expires.
If the application later uses the message_queue_put() or message_queue_get() API functions, if they block the calling task, the still active timer may fire and activate the blocked task unnecessarily.
Since the unblocked task checks the message-queue state again and blocks again if necessary, this is a minor performance issue, but not a correctness issue.
To avoid confusion and to value apparent correctness over optimizations, the implementation shall be changed so that this performance issue does not occur.

Goals
--------

Tasks using the message-queue API shall not have unnecessarily active timers and unnecessarily receive timer signals.
When tasks waiting on a message queue are unblocked, their potentially active timeout timers shall be stopped immediately.

Test Plan
---------

The timer state shall be added to the checked invariants of the message-queue implementation.
Since there are no existing tests for the message-queue component and creating such tests is out of the scope of this task, code review shall suffice to double-check the correctness of the changes in this task.
