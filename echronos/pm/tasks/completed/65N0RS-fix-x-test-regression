Task: 65N0RS-fix-x-test-regression
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------
A regression has occured which makes the x-test test run zero tests. This is due
to an import error in x_test.py which is silently dropped by the test framework.

Goals
--------
Fix the existing regression and investigate possible improvements to the test
system to make identifying this mode of failure more robust.

- Update: testing for this mode of failure involves setting up teamcity to
  work with the python unit test framework, which is a significant amount of
  work and will not be undertaken in this task.

Test Plan
---------
TC tests will run with the correct number of tests.
