Simple RTOS baseline
========================

Goal
-----

The goal of this task is to provide a simple baseline RTOS.
By having a baseline it should be possible to incrementally improve the product to reach the desired goal.
By its very nature the baseline will be missing many features; these can all be addressed in small future tasks.

The simple RTOS will be codenamed *acamar*.
The simple RTOS will just support `rtos_start` and `rtos_yield_to`.
Only a build targeting the POSIX machine will be provided (this is something that should be able to run in a Linux process).

As this is a task designed to provide a baseline and not expecte to be complete as such, review should take this in to account.
