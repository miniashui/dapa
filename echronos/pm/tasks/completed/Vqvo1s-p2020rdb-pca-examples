Task: Vqvo1s-p2020rdb-pca-examples
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

A customer wants eChronos working on a board based on the P2020 chip, which features dual e500 processor cores.
eChronos is only required to run on core 0.

The recently merged task zwIbyS-machine-p2020rdb-pca brought up eChronos on the Freescale P2020RDB-PCA, which is an evaluation board also based on the P2020 chip.
That task only presented example systems corresponding to existing example systems for other platforms.

In order to support the customer, we would also like to provide example systems demonstrating possible implementations for some typical use cases for eChronos on the P2020.


Goals
--------

Addition of example systems for machine-p2020rdb-pca that demonstrate a possible implementation for each of the following, generic use cases:
(1) Delivery of interrupt events to particular tasks using eChronos' interrupt_event_raise API.
(2) Buffering of data between ISR and task, with access to the data synchronized via some platform-specific method.
(3) Sharing of data between two tasks, with access to the data synchronized using some eChronos API.

Incidentally, the systems may also demonstrate use of various P2020-specific hardware features, such as:
- the P2020's Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC), for demultiplexing of external interrupts
- the P2020 PIC's global timers, as interrupt sources
- the P2020's Dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (DUARTs), for interrupt-driven receipt and transmission of bytes

The code should be factored into modules corresponding to driver "libraries" where appropriate, to provide a serving suggestion for how one may structure their project code for reuse.


Test Plan
---------

Build system images in ELF format using prj.py build.

Use the stock U-Boot firmware on the P2020RDB-PCA to load images via 'tftpboot' and run them with 'bootelf':

    tftpboot path/to/img.elf
    interrupts off
    bootelf
