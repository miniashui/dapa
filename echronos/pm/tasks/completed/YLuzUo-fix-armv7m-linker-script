Task: YLuzUo-fix-armv7m-linker-script
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The ARMv7M has a subtle error that causes aligned accesses during startup.
The startup code copies initialised data from flash in to data ram, and does so with a word at a time copy.
For this to work it is essential that both the target and source address are word aligned.
This patch will ensure that linker script always generates aligned addresses.
