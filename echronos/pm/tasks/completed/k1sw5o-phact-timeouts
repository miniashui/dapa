Task: k1sw5o-phact-timeouts
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The recently merged task qQ7uct-phact-pcp-variant added Phact variant which is a clone of Kochab with the priority inheritance scheduler replaced with a priority ceiling scheduler.

In this initial work, the timer API and mutex/semaphore timeout functionality were disabled.

These need to be enabled to bring Phact's functionality up to speed with that of Kochab.


Goals
--------

Enable timer API and mutex/semaphore timeout functionality on Phact variant.


Test Plan
---------

Add timer demo system (using existing timer-test C program) for Phact.

Enable semaphore timeout API test cases on semaphore demo system for Phact.

Add mutex timeout API test cases to the existing phact-mutex-demo C program and Phact system.
