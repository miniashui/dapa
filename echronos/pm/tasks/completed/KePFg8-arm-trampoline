Task: KePFg8-arm-trampoline
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

On ARM, when viewing stack traces in the debugger, the debugger becomes confused as finds frames past the top of the thread's stack.
Improve this by providing a trampoline function that effectively puts a clear stopping frame on the stack.
