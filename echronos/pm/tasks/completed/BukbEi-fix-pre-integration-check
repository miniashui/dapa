Task: BukbEi-fix-pre-integration-check
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The x.py task pre-integration check sometimes fails to detect when a review author's latest review round for a branch is not "accept".

It appears that a more recent round not yet reviewed by an author can cause an earlier "rework" review by that author to be forgotten, because _get_most_recent_reviews_from_all_authors() doesn't check is_done() for each round, meaning it returns the most recent round even if the author hasn't reviewed that round.
This causes the calling code to erroneously discard that author, taking it to mean (presumably) that the author has never reviewed any of the rounds.


Goals
--------

Fix the pre-integration check for x.py task integrate so it doesn't allow a task to integrate when an author asks for a "rework" in a previous round and hasn't pushed an "accepted" review since then.


Test Plan
---------

Test manually by clagging out the relevant code and running it on some sample crafted review directories.

Add test cases to x-test to ensure the check catches the problematic case and passes one that's fine, by having it check the review directories of already-integrated task branches known to exhibit each property.
