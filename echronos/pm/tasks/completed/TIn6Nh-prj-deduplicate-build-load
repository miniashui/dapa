Remove code duplication between build and load actions in prj tool
==================================================================

Motivation
----------
The load action was adopted 1:1 from the existing build action in the prj tool.
This approach lead to significant code duplication.

Goal
----
The primary goal of this task is to refactor the prj tool to avoid the code duplication between the build and load actions.

Approach
--------
The suggested approach to accomplish the goal of this task includes the following elements:

* In the System class, move the instantiation of modules into a single separate function

* In the System class, move the invocation of the prepare() function to a build-related location

* Move the creation of Project and System instances in the build() and load() functions into separate functions and re-use them instead
