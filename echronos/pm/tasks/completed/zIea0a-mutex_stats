Task: zIea0a-mutex_stats
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------
Mutexes and locking can add significant complexity to the dynamic run-time behavior of a system.
Understanding how tasks use mutexes can be extremely valuable in analyzing or debugging system behavior.
Currently, the RTOS does not facilitate this kind of understanding or insight.

Goals
----------
The goal of this task is to collect basic statistical information about how often each mutex in a system is accessed.
This information shall in particular reveal whether a mutex is contended often or for long times.
The collected data shall remain relatively compact in its memory size, with low DRAM impact having a higher priority than collecting detailed information.

Test Plan
----------
The correctness of the existing mutex implementation is tested by the existing mutex tests.

Test systems that include the blocking mutex component shall have mutex statistics enabled as a build regression test.
