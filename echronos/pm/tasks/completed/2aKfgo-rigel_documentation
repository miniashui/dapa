Task: 2aKfgo-rigel_documentation
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The manual for the rigel variant is visually not entirely appealing, lacks graphics files, and is partially inconsistent with the implementation.


Goals
--------

- ensure that all graphics files are included in the generated documentation for the rigel variant
- ensure the visual quality of the generated documentation is similar to that of the original Pages-based manual
- ensure that the documentation is accurate, up-to-date, and consistent with the implementation

Test Plan
---------

# generate rigel manual: x.py build build-manuals

# review generated PDF file, comparing it against original manual and implementation
